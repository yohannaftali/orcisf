# Change History

Dated, chronological record of notable changes to this project. Current
architecture and working rules live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — this file is
history only; don't duplicate current-state description here.

## 1998–1999 — Original thesis project

- **1998-07-15** — First line of source code written (per the header comment in
  [`ORCISF.cpp`](Optimasi%20Beton/Source/ORCISF.cpp)): start of the Tugas Akhir
  (undergraduate thesis) "Optimasi Beton Bertulang Pada Struktur Portal Ruang"
  by Yohan Naftali (7712/TS), Program Studi Teknik Sipil, Universitas Atma Jaya
  Yogyakarta, advised by Dr. Ir. FX. Nurwadji Wibowo, M.Sc. and Ir. Ch. Arief
  Sudibyo.
- **1999-03-08** — Thesis seminar/defense held in Yogyakarta ("Diseminarkan Di
  Yogyakarta Pada Tanggal 8 Maret 1999", per `ORCISF.cpp`).
- **1999 (Jun–Jul)** — Bulk of the `.hpp` modules under `Optimasi Beton/Source/`
  written/dated (structural mechanics, RC design, and Flexible Polyhedron
  optimizer modules).
- **1999-08-10** — v0.01 release: `BacaSaya.txt` (user manual) and the compiled
  `orcisf.exe`/`cw3230.dll` binary dated to this day.
- **1999-08-23** — `orcisf.ico` added.

## 2006 — Follow-up

- **2006** — `Optimasi Beton/Optimasi Struktur Beton.doc` created (file
  timestamp 2006-09-10); binary inspection in 2026 found it has no
  recoverable text or embedded objects — its intended content, if any, is
  lost. A recompiled build (`orcisf.exe` + `cw3230.dll`) with its own
  `aplikasi.*` example dataset was archived under
  `Optimasi Beton/Example/2006/`.

## 2026-08-09 — Repository documented and set up for AI-assisted work

- Repository initialized on GitHub (`yohannaftali/orcisf`), with the existing
  `Optimasi Beton/` archive (source, binary, examples, thesis manuscript) as
  the initial commit.
- Added `.claude/skills/planner` and `.claude/skills/coder` (GitHub-issue
  planning/implementation skills) and `CLAUDE.md` pointing every agent at
  `AGENTS.md`.
- Authored `AGENTS.md` (architecture/working-rules reference), this
  `CHANGE_HISTORY.md`, and expanded `README.md`, based on a full read-through
  of the legacy source (`Optimasi Beton/Source/*.hpp`), the original user
  manual (`BacaSaya.txt`), and the repository layout — documenting the
  structural-analysis + "Flexible Polyhedron" optimization architecture, the
  `.inp`/`.isd`/.../`.opt` file-format convention, and the reserved-but-empty
  `src/` directory for any future modernization work.

## 2026-08-09 — LaTeX transcription of the thesis manuscript

- Added `Optimasi Beton/Teori/latex/`: a LaTeX build of the actual thesis
  (`Teori/Isi/BAB I.doc`–`BAB V.doc`, `Intisari.doc`, `Cover/*.doc`,
  `Daftar/*.doc`), requested as "a LaTeX version of `Optimasi Struktur
  Beton.doc`". That specific file turned out to be empty on inspection (see
  the 2006 entry above), so the transcription targets the real thesis
  content instead, per the user's choice when offered that option.
- Text was extracted with `antiword`; formulas embedded as MathType/
  Equation Editor OLE objects (undetectable as plain text) were
  reconstructed by cross-referencing the surrounding prose against the
  actual C++ implementation in `Source/*.hpp` — see
  `Teori/latex/LEGACY_TRANSCRIPTION_NOTES.md` for the full methodology and
  a breakdown of what's verbatim vs. reconstructed vs. unrecoverable
  (figures; Tabel 2-1's stiffness matrix, rebuilt from the cited Weaver &
  Gere reference instead).
- Compiled and verified with Tectonic 0.17.0 (downloaded standalone, no
  system LaTeX install available) — `main.pdf`, 73 pages, no errors.
  `main.pdf` is checked in alongside the `.tex` sources.

## Big Picture

**ORCISF** (**O**ptimizing **R**einforced **C**oncrete **I**n **S**pace **F**rame
structure) is a **1998–1999 undergraduate thesis (Tugas Akhir S1) engineering
program** written by **Yohan Naftali** (student no. 7712/TS, Program Studi Teknik
Sipil, peminatan Struktur, **Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta**; advisors
**Dr. Ir. FX. Nurwadji Wibowo, M.Sc.** and **Ir. Ch. Arief Sudibyo**). It is a
**DOS-style Win32 console application in Borland C++ 5.02** that:

1. **Analyzes** a 3D reinforced-concrete building frame (space frame) using the
   direct-stiffness method (adapted from Weaver & Gere), and
2. **Optimizes** the cross-section dimensions and reinforcement of every beam and
   column using the **"Flexible Polyhedron"** method — a generalized-simplex,
   direct-search (derivative-free) optimizer in the Nelder–Mead family — to
   **minimize total material cost** (concrete + reinforcing steel) subject to
   strength and serviceability constraints.

This repository is the **archive of that original thesis project**: source code,
compiled binary, sample datasets, and the full written manuscript (in Indonesian).
There is currently **no modern/ported implementation** — see [`src/` (reserved, empty)](#src-reserved-empty)
below.

### `src/` (reserved, empty)

`src/` exists but is currently **empty**. It is not part of the historical
deliverable — treat it as a **placeholder reserved for a possible future
modernization/port** of the engine (e.g. a cross-platform or Python/C++ rewrite).
**Do not assume its intended language, structure, or scope.** If asked to start
work there, confirm the target stack/scope with the user first (or check whether
a `planner`/GitHub issue already defines it) rather than guessing from the legacy
code's structure.

---

## Program Architecture (`Optimasi Beton/Source/`)

Written entirely in **Indonesian** (identifiers, comments, console prompts) —
this is intentional and part of the historical record. Keep new comments/strings
in the same language if extending this legacy code; do not silently translate
existing files. The program is **header-only** (`.hpp`) plus a single tiny
`.cpp` entry point; there is no build system beyond the Borland IDE project file
`ORCISF.ide` (binary, IDE-generated — don't hand-edit it).

- **Entry point:** [`ORCISF.cpp`](Optimasi%20Beton/Source/ORCISF.cpp) — defines
  `const int mak=825;` (the global max-array-size bound used throughout every
  fixed-size array/matrix in the program) and `void main()`, which just calls
  `menu_utama()`.
- **Aggregating header:** [`Header.hpp`](Optimasi%20Beton/Source/Header.hpp)
  `#include`s every module in dependency order; `Proto.hpp` holds every function
  prototype up front (old-style C++, no separate `.cpp`/translation units).
- **Kernel:** `Proto.hpp` (prototypes), `Variabel.hpp` (**all** global
  state/arrays — sized `[mak]`), `InOut.hpp` (interactive console I/O + generic
  filename → extension wiring).
- **Structural mechanics** (direct-stiffness method for 3D space frames,
  developed from Weaver & Gere): `Struktur.hpp` (`struktur()` assembles &
  solves), `Pembebanan.hpp` (loads), `Solver.hpp` (`banfac`/`bansol` — modified
  Choleski banded-matrix factorization/solve).
- **Reinforced-concrete design:**
  - `Kolom.hpp` — class `kolom`: biaxial column capacity/design check
    (slenderness, PN/MNX/MNY interaction, stirrup requirements).
  - `Balok.hpp` — class `balok`: beam flexural/shear design (lapangan = midspan
    vs. tumpuan = support regions, deflection check).
  - `ELEMEN.HPP` — fills beam/column element properties from the current
    discretized design-variable set (`isi_elemen_balok`, `isi_elemen_kolom`).
  - Instantiating a `balok`/`kolom` object as a bare local (e.g. `balok
    lapangan;`) is the pattern used throughout to trigger its constructor's
    side-effecting calculation, which sets the shared globals `kendala`
    (constraint violation) and `harga` (cost) — **not idiomatic modern C++**,
    but consistent throughout; preserve the pattern if touching this code.
- **Optimization — "Flexible Polyhedron" direct search**
  (generalized-simplex / Nelder-Mead family):
  - `Polyhedron.hpp` — `optimasi()`, the main driver (see below).
  - `Penormalan.hpp` — `normalisasi_*`/`unnormalisasi`: pack/unpack the combined
    beam+column discrete design vector.
  - `Pengacakan.hpp` — `acak_variabel()`: randomizes the initial population of
    candidate designs ("struktur" 0..`JSTD-1`).
  - `Diskritisasi.hpp` — `konversi()`: rounds a float to the nearest discrete
    index (design variables are indices into discretized value tables, not
    continuous values — see **Discrete design variables** below).
  - `Kendala.hpp` — `Kendala_Harga()`: for a given design-variable set, runs the
    RC design checks for every beam/column and returns the **fitness**
    `finalti / (harga + finalti*kendala)` (cost combined with a constraint
    penalty; `finalti` is the user-supplied penalty factor).
  - `Telusur.hpp` — `penelusuran()`: locates the search direction from the
    midpoint of the "good" points toward/away from the worst point.
  - `Baru.hpp` — `cari_baru()`: reflects/expands along that direction to find a
    new candidate point.
  - `Pengurutan.hpp` — `sort()`: bubble-sorts the population by fitness.
  - **Driver flow** (`optimasi()` in `Polyhedron.hpp`): classify each member as
    beam or column by inclination (`periksa_batang`, `CXZ`) → design-variable
    count `JVD = 12*jum_balok + 5*jum_kolom` → population size
    `JSTD = JVD*fak_kali + fak_plus` → generate & evaluate `JSTD` random initial
    designs → sort by fitness → loop: search direction → new point → replace
    worst if better, else shrink ("penyusutan") → check convergence (best
    fitness unchanged, or too many consecutive shrinks) or `j_iterasi_mak`
    generations → write `.his` log throughout, then `cetak_akhir()` writes the
    final `.opt`/`.str`/`.kdl`/`.inf` files.
- **Shell / presentation:** `Tampilan.hpp` (`menu_utama()` — the console menu,
  see **Running the program** below; `about()` — banner), `CETAK.HPP`
  (`cetak_akhir()` — writes the four final output files).
- `BorlandC.hpp` — the legacy Borland C++ 5.02 include set (`iostream.h`,
  `conio.h`, `dos.h`, `_defs.h`, …, all pre-standard headers with no
  namespaces). **This will not compile as-is on a modern compiler** (MSVC/GCC/
  Clang) — see **Build & Run** below.

### Discrete design variables (why the numbers look like indices, not sizes)

Cross-sections and reinforcement are **not** continuous — the user supplies
discrete candidate tables per structure (widths/heights/column sides in `.isd`,
bar diameters in `.idl`/`.ids`, bar counts in `.ijl`, stirrup spacings in
`.ijs`). A design variable (e.g. `var_b[struct][0]`) stores an **index into**
one of these tables (`sisi_d_B`, `DIA_d`, `NL_d`, `DIAS_d`, `JS_d`, …), and
`isi(index, table)` resolves it to the actual value. Per-beam there are **12**
such indices (B, H, top/bottom bar diameter+count at midspan, same at support,
stirrup diameter, stirrup spacing); per-column there are **5** (side, bar
diameter, bar count, stirrup diameter, stirrup spacing). This is what
`JVD = 12*jum_balok + 5*jum_kolom` counts.

---

## Data / File Format Convention (`InOut.hpp`, `Pembebanan.hpp`, `Tampilan.hpp`)

The user supplies one **generic base filename** (no extension, e.g. `contoh`);
the program derives every input/output filename by appending a fixed extension
(8.3-style, DOS-era). All input files are **plain ASCII** and editable in a text
editor. **Keep this table in sync with `InOut.hpp`/`Variabel.hpp` if the file
format is ever changed:**

| Ext | Direction | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `.inp` | in | General structure data (geometry, joints, restraints, materials) |
| `.isd` | in | Discrete beam width/height & column side dimensions |
| `.idl` | in | Discrete main (longitudinal) reinforcement diameters |
| `.ijl` | in | Discrete main reinforcement bar counts |
| `.ids` | in | Discrete stirrup diameters |
| `.ijs` | in | Discrete stirrup spacings |
| `.bbn` | in | Load data |
| `.his` | out | Optimization run history/log (one line per shrink/convergence event) |
| `.opt` | out | Final optimized beam/column dimensions & reinforcement |
| `.str` | out | Structural analysis results (forces/displacements) |
| `.kdl` | out | Constraint-check results |
| `.inf` | out | Echo of the input/geometry data actually used |

`Optimasi Beton/BacaSaya.txt` is the original author-written user manual for
this format (Indonesian) — read it before changing any I/O routine.

---

## Sample Datasets (`Optimasi Beton/Example/`)

Each subdirectory is a self-contained example with a matching set of the
extensions above:
- `Data01`, `Data02+3`, `Data02x2`, `Data03x2`, `Data04+3` — original thesis
  validation datasets (referenced from the `Lampiran`/`Isi` chapters).
- `Apl1-1`..`Apl1-5`, `Apl2-1`..`Apl2-5`, `Apl3-1`..`Apl3-5` — application/case
  study datasets (3 building configurations × 5 variants each).
- `2006/` — a later recompiled build (`orcisf.exe` + `cw3230.dll` dated 2006)
  bundled with its own `aplikasi.*` dataset; kept alongside the 1999 binary in
  the root of `Optimasi Beton/` as a historical snapshot.

---

## Running the Program (as originally shipped)

`Optimasi Beton/orcisf.exe` is a **Win32 console application**; it requires
`cw3230.dll` (Borland runtime) in the same directory. Run it from a Windows
console (`cmd.exe`) in that folder. The interactive menu (`menu_utama()` in
`Tampilan.hpp`):

1. **Input data awal ke file** — enter general + discrete design data, writes
   `.inp`/`.isd`/`.idl`/`.ijl`/`.ids`/`.ijs`.
2. **Input data beban ke file** — enter load data, writes `.bbn`.
3. **Melihat isi file input** — browse an existing input set (general data,
   joint coordinates, member info, restraints, fixed-end forces, joint loads).
4. **Mengoptimasi struktur** — prompts for the generic filename, concrete/steel
   unit prices, column/beam cover thickness, penalty factor, max iterations,
   and the population-size add/multiply factors, then runs `optimasi()`
   (per `BacaSaya.txt`: use ≥10000 iterations for good results).
5. **Keluar** — exit.

To run a bundled `Example/` case, enter its path relative to the working
directory as the generic filename (e.g. `example/contoh`), per `BacaSaya.txt`.

---

## Build & Run From Source (legacy toolchain)

The source targets **Borland C++ 5.02** for **Win32 console**, using
pre-standard headers (`iostream.h`, `conio.h`, `dos.h`, DOS-console calls like
`gotoxy`/`clrscr`/`textcolor`/`gettime`). It **cannot be compiled unmodified**
with a modern compiler (MSVC/GCC/Clang/MinGW) — those headers and console APIs
don't exist there. To rebuild as originally written you need Borland C++ 5.02
(or a compatible Borland/Turbo C++ toolchain) and open
[`ORCISF.ide`](Optimasi%20Beton/Source/ORCISF.ide). If asked to **port** this to
a modern toolchain, that is a nontrivial rewrite (replace `conio.h` console I/O,
`void main()` → `int main()`, `<iostream.h>` → `<iostream>` + `std::`, DOS timing
calls, etc.) — treat it as new work under `src/`, not an in-place edit of
`Optimasi Beton/Source/`, so the historical source stays intact.

---

## Conventions & Guardrails

- **`Optimasi Beton/` is a historical archive.** Do not "clean up," reformat,
  translate, or modernize the original 1999 source/binary/manuscript in place
  unless the user explicitly asks for a fix to that exact legacy code. New
  work (ports, tooling, docs) belongs elsewhere (`src/`, root-level docs).
- **Keep Indonesian identifiers/comments/strings** when editing existing legacy
  files — the codebase and thesis are historically and linguistically
  consistent; don't mix languages within a file.
- **`mak = 825`** (in `ORCISF.cpp`) is the compile-time bound for every
  `[mak]`-sized global array/matrix — changing it changes memory layout
  throughout and requires a full rebuild; it is not a runtime-configurable
  limit.
- **File-naming convention is load-bearing**: the generic-name + fixed-extension
  scheme is duplicated across `InOut.hpp`, `Pembebanan.hpp`, and `Tampilan.hpp`.
  If you ever change an extension or add a new I/O file, update **all three**
  plus the table in this file and in `BacaSaya.txt`.
- **`ORCISF.ide` is a binary, IDE-generated project file** — don't hand-edit it;
  regenerate via the Borland IDE if the file list changes.
- **`.doc` files under `Teori/`** are legacy MS Word 97-2003 binary format —
  don't attempt to "fix" or re-save them as part of unrelated changes.
- **No test harness exists.** The only historical validation is: run
  `orcisf.exe` (or a rebuild) against the `Example/` datasets and compare
  `.opt`/`.str`/`.kdl` output to what's already checked in for that example, or
  to the results discussed in `Teori/Isi/BAB IV.doc`.
- **License:** no license file is currently included in this repository. Don't
  add one speculatively — confirm with the user (the original author) first.

## Agent Skills (`.claude/skills/`)

AI agents working in this repo should check [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/)
for skills that apply to the current task and follow them.

- **`planner`** ([`.claude/skills/planner/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/planner/SKILL.md)) —
  context-aware issue tracker for GitHub. Use this instead of raw API
  calls/`curl` whenever creating, updating, or checking issues/tickets, even if
  the user doesn't say "GitHub" explicitly (e.g. "create a task", "log this as
  an issue", "plan this feature").
- **`coder`** ([`.claude/skills/coder/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/coder/SKILL.md)) —
  picks up an open issue from the remote tracker, plans/splits the work, and
  implements the fix following this file's conventions. Use for "fix an
  issue", "work on a ticket", "implement issue #X". Shares remote-repo/token
  resolution with `planner` via [`.claude/skills/_shared/references/`](.claude/skills/_shared/references/).

---

## GitHub Workflow

- **Remote repo:** `origin` → `https://github.com/yohannaftali/orcisf.git`
  (`yohannaftali/orcisf`).
- **Branch strategy:** single `main` branch currently (no CI/deploy pipeline —
  this is a documentation/archive repository, not a running service). Confirm
  with the user before assuming a feature-branch workflow is wanted.

## Tracked Issues

None yet. Use the `planner` skill to create the first entries when there is
concrete work to track (e.g. a modernization/port effort under `src/`, or a
fix to a specific legacy calculation).

---

## Validation (before pushing)

- **Docs-only changes** (this file, `README.md`, `CHANGE_HISTORY.md`): just
  proofread — there's no build step for them.
- **Legacy source changes** (`Optimasi Beton/Source/`): there is no modern way
  to compile-check them in this environment (Borland C++ 5.02 only). At
  minimum, review the change against the surrounding style and note in the
  commit/PR that it is **untested** (no compiler available) unless you have
  independently verified it against a Borland toolchain.
- **New `src/` work:** validate with whatever toolchain that work adopts; make
  sure its own build/run/test instructions get added to this file once it
  exists.

---

## Change Log Policy

- Use **this file (`AGENTS.md`)** for the *current* architecture, structure, and
  working rules only.
- Put **chronological / dated implementation history** in
  [`CHANGE_HISTORY.md`](CHANGE_HISTORY.md) — one dated entry per notable change.
- **When `AGENTS.md` grows large**, compact it: summarize/replace stale detail
  here and move the removed history into `CHANGE_HISTORY.md`. Record the
  compaction date below.
- Every agent that makes a structural/architectural change **must** update both
  files in the same change.

_Last architecture/state compaction: 2026-08-09 (initial AGENTS.md authored)._
